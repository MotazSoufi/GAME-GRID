# GAME GRID

Game Grid is a full stack website that I am developing as a personal project for practice and gaining additional knowledge. This website has a collection of games across various gaming platforms that allows users to browse through and create their own lists and receive news on their favorite video games. So far, I have implemented jQuery, MongoDB, NodeJS, and ExpressJS into this project.
